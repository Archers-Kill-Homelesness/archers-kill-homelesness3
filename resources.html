         <p>Community shelters are an effective way to provide housing to houseless individuals. Although there are many shelters within NYC, there is still a large gap between sheltered and unsheltered homeless individuals. NYC DHS reports that 68,884 people slept in shelters each night however there are 74,178 people in total. That leaves an 11.51% gap in unsheltered homeless individuals.</p>

          <p>Food kitchens are a great way to help homeless individuals. Food and living costs are a leading cause of homelessness. Even when temporary shelter is found, hundreds of homeless individuals are left hungry. Having access to nutrcious and safe food items greatly increases the quality of cute homeless people experience.</p>
