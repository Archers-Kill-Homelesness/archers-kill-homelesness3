        <h1>Shelters</h1>
         <p>Community shelters are an effective way to provide housing to houseless individuals. Although there are many shelters within NYC, there is still a large gap between sheltered and unsheltered homeless individuals. NYC DHS reports that 68,884 people slept in shelters each night however there are 74,178 people in total. That leaves an 11.51% gap in unsheltered homeless individuals.</p>
